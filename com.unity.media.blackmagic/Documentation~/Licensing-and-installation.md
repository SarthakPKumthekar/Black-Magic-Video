 You can use the [Graphics Compositor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@10.2/manual/Compositor-User-Guide.html) tool to do compositing between the Blackmagic Input Video and the Unity scene. This tool is:
 
* Not mandatory.

Using a multi-card setup requires you to rename your Logical Devices in the `Label` field using the [Blackmagic Desktop Video](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/product/capture-and-playback) Setup. The Device `Label` field is used to select a different Connector mapping per card.
